Example of a generated website

## To use:
- Clone the source code via git
- Delete the provided `example.md` and `example.html`  in the docs/ folder if you want to
- Put your own `.md` file in the docs/ folder
- Run the rust script by
```
 cargo run
 ```

Now your docs folder should include the generated `<your markdown file name>.html` file
